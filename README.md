# Connect 
  Connect is a platform where the students can come together and share their knowledge about
  different technologies on a single platform. Connect allows students/staff to ask questions on
  a particular topic and can expect answers from their colleagues. Connect also allows admin
  to post various institute level notices and events and can also add staff members. Similarly,
  staff can also post notices on events at their department level. This can be also be done by
  some specific students (like Committee Head, etc.).
